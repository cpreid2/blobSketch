# blobSketch

We begin life as blobs â€”
fluid and curious,
boundaries undefined, shapes unformed.

But slowly our edges become rigid, lines drawn by judgment, by fear, by rules
we never asked for.

We are told to remain static,
to stay within the lines.
***

**May blobSketch inspire you
to push gently at your own edges,
to wobble,
and to find freedom
in the joyful,
judgment-free dance
of becoming.**
